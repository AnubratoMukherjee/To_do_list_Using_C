# To_do_list_Using_C
 This project is basically a implementation of to do list using C :

 This project demonstrates basic data structure operations (insertion, deletion, traversal) using a linked list in C, which is a common task in data structures and algorithms (DSA) projects.

 Explanation :

 Explanation:
Task Structure: A Task structure is defined to store the details of each task, including its ID, description, and a pointer to the next task.

Task Creation: The createTask function allocates memory for a new task and initializes it.

Adding Tasks: The addTask function adds a new task to the end of the linked list.

Deleting Tasks: The deleteTask function removes a task from the list by its ID.

Viewing Tasks: The viewTasks function prints out all the tasks in the list.

Memory Management: The freeTasks function frees all the allocated memory before the program exits.

Menu and Main Loop: The displayMenu function shows the user options, and the main function handles user input and calls the appropriate functions.
